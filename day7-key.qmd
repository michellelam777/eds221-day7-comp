## Joins

```{r}
animals <- tibble::tribble(
             ~location,   ~species,  ~maturity,
              "lagoon",   "bobcat",    "adult",
               "bluff",   "coyote", "juvenile",
               "creek",      "fox",    "adult",
                "oaks", "squirrel", "juvenile",
               "bluff",   "bobcat",    "adult"
             )

sites <- tibble::tribble(
           ~location,      ~full_site_name, ~jurisdiction,
             "beach",       "Goleta Beach",     "SB City",
            "lagoon",        "UCSB Lagoon",        "UCSB",
             "bluff",       "Ellwood Mesa",     "SB City",
              "oaks", "Fremont Campground",        "USFS"
           )

```

### Full Join

```{r}
# if not specified it will use the column names to find a matching key 
# can specify the matching key using by = 
full_join_example <- full_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Left Join

```{r}
left_join_example <- left_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Inner Join

```{r}
inner_join_example <- inner_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

```{r}
sites_2 <- sites |> 
  rename(loc = location)
```

Example of joining when key variables have non-matching names

```{r}
nonmatching <- full_join(animals, sites_2, by = c("location" = "loc"))
```

### Semi Join

```{r}
semi_join_example <- semi_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

### Anti join

```{r}
anti_join_example <- anti_join(animals, sites, by = "location")
```

Refresher 1 Practice

```{r}
penguins_filtered <- penguins |> 
  filter(island %in% c("Biscoe", "Dream")) |> 
  select(-year, -sex) |> 
  mutate(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) |> 
  rename(location = island)
```
